# PizzaHAL-GUI
A pizza ordering web application created using the Blazor framework within .NET 8.

*What Does It Do?*
Similar to a production pizza ordering service, this site allows the user to create a cart of customizable food items. The page includes easy to read menu displays that clearly show the prices and available customization for each item. Once they have finished ordering, the user checks out at the end of the process. An extra charge is added to the subtotal if the user chooses to get their order delived rather than picking it up. The site includes seperate pages for each of the item types and checkout process, with the pages being navigatable through a navigation bar. This site was created for a project early within my programming journey, so the source code includes some redundant statements and poor optimization; however, this project still demonstrates many skills in .NET, Blazor, and web design.

*How Does It Work?*
The UI for this page was created using HTML with CSS styling. In addition, many of the image assets such as the menus and header banner were created using Photoshop. The site's functionality makes use of object oriented programming principles to genereate cart items as objects.
